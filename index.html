                <p>
                    I am a third year Computer Engineering student at Sinhgad College of
                    Engineering, Pune. My focus has been web development, and have
                    always been interested in the backend side of things, and coming up
                    with user-friendly digital solutions

                        <h3>TRAVEL TRACKER</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is a web application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                            Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. It allows the users to
                            input names of countries they have visited, save them in a
                            database, and see them highlighted on a map or as a list,
                            providing a very personal record of travel.
                        </p>

                        <h3>GEMINI AI PROJECT</h3>
                        <p>Developed an interactive AI chatbot model inspired by the Gemini AI project, utilizing HTML,
                            CSS for a responsive user interface, and JavaScript for handling chatbot logic and
                            conversation
                            flow. Implemented a clean, intuitive front-end design, enhancing user engagement and
                            experience.

                        <h3>WORLD CAPITALS QUIZ</h3>
                        <p>This project involved building an interactive quiz webpage that tests users on the knowledge
                            of world capitals. The front-end was built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement dynamic
                            user interaction. The back-end was powered by Node.js and Express.js to handle quiz logic
                            and
                            API requests. PostgreSQL was used as a database to store quiz questions, user scores, and
                            results, ensuring data persistence and seamless quiz experiences.

                <h3>INTRODUCTION OF GITHUB</h3>
                <p>
                    I took a series of courses on Microsoft Learn that included an <b>Introduction to GitHub, GitHub
                    Administration, and GitHub Products</b>. These courses really prepared me in how to use GitHub
                    for source control, manage my repositories, as well as understand and have knowledge about
                    various GitHub products and features. With these learning exercises, I acquired badges for each
                    course.
